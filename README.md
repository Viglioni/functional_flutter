# About

The main goal of this project is create a functional -- as in functional programming -- flutter app. Each page is a functionality / small individual app routed in homepage.

## StartUpNames

A simple app with two global states: a random startup name generator and a counter of how many times the user hits "get new name" button.

This app uses [Redux](https://pub.dev/packages/redux) for managing states and [English Words](https://pub.dev/packages/english_words) lib to generate the name.

This app uses no classes - except the default ones.
